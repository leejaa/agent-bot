# Polymind — Marketing Activity Log

> Single source of truth for every marketing action. **Update immediately** after any submission, post, or share so future sessions (and future-you) can pick up context without re-reading transcripts.
>
> Companion: `docs/marketing-assets.md` (the *what* — copy, FAQ, logos, screenshots, demo video to attach). This file tracks the *where / when / status*.

## How to update

- Add or update a row **right after** taking an action — don't batch
- Status values:
  - `pending` — listed as a target, not yet submitted
  - `submitted` — form sent, awaiting review
  - `live` — publicly visible
  - `rejected` — declined (note reason)
  - `expired` — listing went stale or was removed
- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO)
- Once `live`, paste the public URL in the URL column
- Keep `Notes` short. Long context → bottom **Action timeline** section
- For sessions: read the **Current snapshot** + **Roadmap progress** sections first to recover state in <30s

### 2026-05-12

- ✅ First 3 tweets posted on @usepolymind — "Polymind is live" (📌 pinned), blog post share, build-in-public insight
- ✅ Locale switcher removed — app is English-only now

### 2026-05-08
- ✅ Content engine — blog infrastructure: MDX (next-mdx-remote + gray-matter + remark-gfm), `/blog` index + `/blog/[slug]` routes under `[locale]`, Article JSON-LD per post, OG/Twitter metadata per post, sitemap auto-includes posts. All blog routes `force-static`. Build green: `/en/blog`, `/ko/blog`, `/en/blog/<slug>`, `/ko/blog/<slug>` all SSG.
- ✅ First blog post drafted — `gpt-vs-claude-vs-gemini-10-prompts.mdx` (~2.5k words, MDX). Framework-style hands-on comparison (10 prompts for readers to run themselves) — avoids fabricated benchmark numbers, drives readers into Polymind to do the actual comparison. SEO target: "GPT vs Claude vs Gemini" + adjacent intent queries. GEO-friendly (TL;DR, table, named framework, quotable section headers).
- ✅ Programmatic SEO infrastructure — `/compare/[slug]`, `/alternatives/[slug]` routes under `[locale]`; data layer (`src/lib/seo/models.ts`, `comparisons/`, `alternatives/`); 8 template components (`ComparisonPage`, `AlternativePage`, `TaskMatrix`, `ModelSpecCard`, `ComparisonVerdict`, `WhenToPickPanel`, `FaqList`, `PolymindCTA`). All routes `force-static`. Article + FAQPage JSON-LD per page. Sitemap + middleware + footer wired.
- ✅ pSEO first 4 pages live in build (10 SSG routes incl. en/ko + indexes): `/compare/gpt-vs-claude`, `/compare/claude-vs-gemini`, `/compare/gpt-vs-gemini`, `/alternatives/chatgpt`. Each ~1100 words of unique copy (10-task matrix + verdict + when-to-pick + 5 FAQs + reasons-to-switch). Designed to avoid thin-content penalty — every page contains an actual argument, not template variable substitution.
- ✅ Geist font replacement — Jua removed; `next/font/google` Geist + Geist_Mono with Pretendard as Korean fallback. DevTools verified: Geist applies sitewide, Pretendard fallback registered, `--font-jua` reference 0. Visual + computed-style checks passed on landing, blog, and pSEO pages.
- ✅ GSC manual indexing requests — submitted 6 URLs via Claude Desktop computer use: `/compare/gpt-vs-claude`, `/compare/claude-vs-gemini`, `/compare/gpt-vs-gemini`, `/alternatives`, `/alternatives/chatgpt`, plus one more (likely `/blog/gpt-vs-claude-vs-gemini-10-prompts`). All "URL not on Google" → "색인 생성 요청됨" confirmed. Expected indexing in 24-72h.
  - 🔍 Note: `/compare` index page may not have been included in the batch. If GSC report 24-72h later shows it not indexed, re-submit manually.
- ✅ IndexNow infrastructure installed — Bing/Yandex/Naver/Seznam instant-indexing protocol.
  - Key: `859d35dc-4eae-4750-bf9a-bc7597e40c28` (verification file at `public/<key>.txt`)
  - Library: `src/lib/seo/indexnow.ts` (runtime helper, not yet wired into deploy hook)
  - Script: `scripts/notify-indexnow.mjs` — reads sitemap, submits all URLs in one call
  - Run after each deploy: `npm run notify-indexnow`
  - Optional: pass specific URLs as args to submit only those, e.g. `npm run notify-indexnow -- https://usepolymind.app/compare/gpt-vs-claude`
  - Bing daily quota: ~10K URLs (vs Google's much tighter). 200 = success, 202 = first-time key verification.
- ✅ IndexNow first call — 2026-05-08, 15 URLs submitted (all sitemap entries: landing en/ko, sign-in en/ko, blog en/ko index + 1 post, compare en/ko index + 3 comparisons, alternatives en/ko index + 1 alternative). Response 202 Accepted (first-time key verification). Bing/Yandex/Naver/Seznam should index within hours.
- 🚫 HN Show HN attempt — 2026-05-08, blocked by HN's "new account / low karma" Show HN restriction. Account `leeJahun` has 1 karma. Title/URL/copy all correct; submission engine refused. Pivoting to Reddit. HN re-attempt deferred until karma ~30+ (achievable via 5-10 quality comments on existing threads over a few days).
- 🚫 Reddit r/SideProject attempt — 2026-05-08, posted then auto-removed by Reddit's spam filters within ~1h ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1t6zb78/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1t6zb78/)). Account `u/No-Writer189` appears new/low-karma; combined with new domain (usepolymind.app, no reputation history) → auto-filtered. Body/title/link all correct — pure account-trust issue, not content issue.
- 📋 Account-trust strategy: HN + Reddit promotion both blocked by same root cause (low-karma accounts + new domain). Pivoting to channels that don't gate on account reputation: Dev.to cross-post, Indie Hackers, LinkedIn personal. Long-term: build karma on both platforms with 1-2 quality comments/day for 1-2 weeks before retrying primary submission.
- ✅ Bing Webmaster — verified `usepolymind.app/` via HTML meta tag (`msvalidate.01`); sitemap submitted, status "Processing" (normal — Bing will crawl within hours)
- 🔍 Minor finding: `<meta name="msvalidate.01">` renders on `/` and `/ko` but not on `/en`. Likely a next-intl `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` quirk where `/en` is non-canonical. Bing fetches `/` (the registered URL) so verification works. Logged for later investigation.
- ✅ Phase 1 #9, #10 — FAQ section added to landing (matches FAQPage schema), Features keywords boosted ("Compare GPT, Claude, and Gemini")
- 🔍 Speed Insights baseline (mobile P75, 7d): RES 64; FCP 4.86s, LCP 4.86s, TTFB 1.92s, INP 120ms (good), CLS 0 (good). Worst route /chat (RES 57); best /sign-in (100).
- ✅ web-quality-audit (Addy Osmani skill) installed; cross-checked RUM with code review — 3 root causes identified (Pretendard CDN render-blocking, getModels SSR blocking, HeroDemo bundle in critical path)
- ✅ SEO/perf Phase A deployed: Pretendard self-hosted via next/font/local; landing made `force-static` with auth redirect moved to middleware; HeroDemo split into dynamic chunk; getModels() now streams via Suspense boundary
  - Verification: `x-nextjs-prerender: 1` + `x-vercel-cache: HIT` confirmed (icn1 POP serving Korea); 0 references to cdn.jsdelivr.net; Pretendard auto-preloaded same-origin
  - RUM impact will surface in 24-48h; expected: Korean P75 TTFB 1.92s → ~150ms, RES 64 → 88+

## Tips for future-you / future Claude

- **Don't repeat asset work.** Everything you need is in `docs/marketing-assets.md` and `public/`. If a directory's form has fields not covered, add it to `marketing-assets.md`, don't recreate copy from scratch.
- **Track everything.** Even "soft" actions (DM'd a creator, replied to a tweet) belong in this log — saves duplicated effort and reveals what's working.
- **Update the snapshot.** When taking a multi-day break, refresh the **Current snapshot** section so the next session knows the state in 5 seconds.
- **Roadmap order matters.** AI directories first → SEO/social proof → PH launch (max impact) → Reddit/HN/X amplify. Don't skip directories before PH; they raise PH's launch ceiling.
